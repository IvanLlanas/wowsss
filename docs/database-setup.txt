
To accept connection from other hosts:
$ sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
or
$ sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
and:
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
// In MySQL additionally:
mysqlx-bind-address = 0.0.0.0

mysql -u root -p
>CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
